## The Ceremony

> We are gathered here today to celebrate one of life's greatest moments,
> and to witness the vows which will unite John and Katrina in marriage.
>
> Marriage is the promise between two people who love each other,
> and who trust in that love, who honor one another as individuals,
> and who wish to spend the rest of their lives together.
>
> This ceremony will not create a relationship that does not already exist between you.
> It is a milestone in the relationship you began building three years ago
> and an opportunity to formally commit, in front of friends and family,
> to live your lives, which began on separate paths, as one;
> to continue growing stronger as individuals and as partners,
> no matter what challenges or successes you encounter together in the years before you.
>
> At this time John and Katrina would like to read their own vows:

> <p class="kat">John, I promise to treat you with kindness and respect.</p>

> <p class="john">Katrina, I promise to treat you with loyalty and consideration.</p>

> <p class="kat">I promise to work with you on every challenge that comes our way.</p>

> <p class="john">I promise not to take for granted the hundred things you do for me each day.</p>

> <p class="kat">I promise to communicate with you even when it's hard to put my thoughts into words.</p>

> <p class="john">I promise to try to keep it brief.</p>

> <p class="kat">Thank you for being my best friend. I love you.</p>

> <p class="john">I love you. Thank you for marrying me.</p>

> John, do you take Katrina to be your wife, your partner in life and your one true love? Do you give your hand, your heart, and your love, from this day forward for as long as you both shall live?

> <p class="john">I do.</p>

> May I have the rings, please? \[Best Man gives rings to Officiant\]
>
